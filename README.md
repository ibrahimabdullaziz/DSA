# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository is a small part of my **learning journey** in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It contains structured folders where I will progressively add implementations, exercises, and experiments. Each folder is focused on a specific DSA topic, and the code will grow over time as I learn and practice.

> This repo is mainly for personal learning, but contributions, suggestions, and PRs are welcome!  
> If you want to add implementations or enhancements, feel free to create a pull request.

##  Goals

- Build a strong understanding of core data structures.  
- Implement algorithms from scratch to understand their logic and performance.  
- Practice solving problem-solving challenges.  
- Track learning progress using commits and well-typed code examples.
